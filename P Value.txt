In statistics, the p-value is the probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results of a statistical hypothesis test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. The p-value is used as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. A smaller p-value means that there is stronger evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

A p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance.

The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference.

P-value can be used as an alternative to or in addition to preselected confidence levels for hypothesis testing.
