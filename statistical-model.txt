Suppose that we randomly draw n individuals from a certain population and measure their height. The measurements can be regarded as realizations of n random variables [eq1]. In principle, these random variables could have any probability distribution. If we assume that they have a normal distribution, as it is often done for height measurements, then we are formulating a statistical model: we are placing a restriction on the set of probability distributions that could have generated the data.
